So i'm thinking we should start using this for sharing stuff you've worked up without the rest of the group 
I for example just put all our database classes into a package called 'Database' as you can see
Please update the project before commiting anything so that we all have this package
We need to divide into packages in order to separate the backend code and our GUI later on
