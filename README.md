Sooo i'm thinking we should start using this for sharing stuff, instead of just having random sentences here.
I for example, just put all our database classes into a package called 'Database' as you can see.
Please update the project before commiting anything, so that we all have this package.
We need to divide into packages in order to separate the backend code and our GUI later on.
Peace out y'all
